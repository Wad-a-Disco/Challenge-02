            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Wade Desco. I am an aspiring coder. As of today 04/12/2023, I am 19 years old. My education is as follows, I went to San Clemente High School from 2017-2021. I then went to Saddleback Communtity College for a year. I am now taking a UCI coding bootcamp course to expand my coding skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I officially started my coding off with an "Introduction into Coding" at Saddleback. The class taught C++. One of the classes for the introductory course, which was called CS1C, used the command line to run and debug the code. I also took some machine language courses at Saddleback. However, these courses were only introduction courses. Throught my life I have been a hardworker with anything I wanted to do in life. My current goals are to one day help and aid in the creation of a video game whether it's my own or working with a team. I also want to try and dabble more in machine language and machine learning. These are two topics that I am very interested in. Below are some projects that I have worked on in the past. I am hoping to add some more catagories as my coding career develops. :D
